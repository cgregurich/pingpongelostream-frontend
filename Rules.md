##  Rules relevant to the business logic

Serve for 2 points, then swap who's serving. Doesn't matter who wins the point.

First to 11 wins, however it must be by 2 points.

## Rules relevant to the players

A failed serve gives the point the non-serving player.

A "let" is when, during a serve, the ball hits the net yet still goes over it. When this occurs, the serve is replayed. There is no limit to the number of lets in a row that a player can have.

The ball must bounce exactly once onto the other side of the table.

If P1 hits the ball before it bounces on their side, P2 gets the point. However, if the ball is past the backline of the table (it was going out of bounds), and the player volleys it, it's still their point. The fact that the ball is out of bounds trumps the fact that the player volleyed the ball.
